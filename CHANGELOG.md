## 0.1.1
* Updated the create to submit the app_metadata hash.

## 0.1.0
* Updated the configuration so a config block can be used. Any setting on the model will override the config block.
* Changed the default for the Auth0 namespace setting to look at 'AUTH0_NAMESPACE' instead of 'AUTH0_DOMAIN'.
* Changed the attribute settings to use non-abbreviated variable names.
* Updated the usage to include the fields to sync separate from the rest of the config.
* A bunch of refactoring of methods into multiple modules to hopefully improve future maintenance (Configuration, Validation, Sync, etcetera).
* Updated the sync so on create and on update, it determines if the sync to Auth0 should be a create or patch separately (to resolve issues with data inconsistency).
* Updated the Auth0 update to always submit passwords and emails when they are changed, even if they are not fields to sync (that shouldn't be a requirement).

* Added the ability to send password changes on-update.

## 0.0.13
* Added auth0 and jwt gems as dependencies.
